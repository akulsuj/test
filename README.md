7.1. BYPASSING 404 ERRORS TO ACCESS THE ADMIN PAGE

Description:
The vulnerability "Bypassing 404 Errors to Access the Admin Page" demonstrates a flaw in how
a web server handles URL requests, allowing unauthorized access to restricted areas of a
website, such as the admin panel. In this scenario, an attacker uses a tool like Burp Suite to
intercept and manipulate HTTP requests. Initially, when attempting to access the admin page
through the URL path "/home/admin," the server responds with a "404 Not Found" error,
indicating that the resource is unavailable. However, by altering the request to include the full
URL "https://sadrd.manulife.com/home/admin" in the HTTP request line, the server responds
with a "200 OK" status, granting access to the admin panel. This indicates a potential
misconfiguration or oversight in the server's routing logic, which fails to consistently handle
different URL formats, thereby exposing sensitive areas of the application to unauthorized
users. Proper URL validation and consistent handling of request paths are critical in mitigating
such vulnerabilities.
Proof of Concept:
1. Open the Burp Suite and its integrated browser.
2. Navigate the specified URL in the browser, then look at the request from the Burp
history.
3. Send the request to the Burp Repeater.

4. Manipulate the request as shown below.
Figure 3. The restricted /home/admin path is now accessible.
Recommended Remediation:
To remediate the vulnerability of bypassing 404 errors to access restricted pages, it's essential
to implement strict URL validation and routing consistency across the web server. Ensure that
all URL paths are correctly configured to handle different formats uniformly, preventing
unauthorized access. Additionally, employ robust access control mechanisms that require
authentication and authorization checks for sensitive areas such as the admin panel,
irrespective of how the URL is formatted.
